### Paul

Cool project idea! I think it would be great if you could get that social media integration, especially since a lot of those sites will maintain the image locational meta data (obivously, if the uploaded image has it to begin with).

### Andrew

If you do decide to end-up doing a responsive site, you should consider leveraging GPS location and going for a single page application (if you're using Angular or any front-end framework like you said in your implementation section this will probably easier), though these may not be priorities if you're just trying to get a site up and running.

### Brian

Look into using [ExifRead](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ExifRead) to extract location data from the exif metadata of images.  I think you should go with your idea of integrating with an external image API.  Otherwise, the backend models look like grumblr but with images instead of text.  Creating your own API also achieves this.
